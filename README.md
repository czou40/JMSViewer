### Notepad Program Capable of Encrypting Texts
The program can encrypt texts and save the encrypted document as .jms files. The encryption algorithm has something to do with the ASCII Codes associated with a character and the password the user inputs.
This program has not been maintained for 3 years. Back then, I had poor coding practices such as arbitrarily naming variables and not fully modularizing my codes. Nevertheless, this program is a finished product since I managed to implement all the functions a normal notepad program should have, such as redo, undo, replace, find, etc.
